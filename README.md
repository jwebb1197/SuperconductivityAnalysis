# Superconductivity Analysis
An analysis of the Superconductivity dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Specifically, the train.csv file from this data folder will be explored. This file provides values of 81 features, along with Critical Temperature, of 21,263 superconductors. Note that *Critical Temperature* is considered the response variable of this dataset, with the other 81 features considered the predictors. Correlation and mutual conditional entropy between these features are explored, and XGBoost is applied to predict the Critical Temperature of superconductors based on their feature values. Additionally, hierarchical clustering is performed on the predicting variables, with row labeling by a discretized version of *Critical Temperature*.
